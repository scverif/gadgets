## Introduction ##
This repository contains masked implementations for Arm Cortex-M
micro-controllers and code to guide their analysis using "scVerif" and
[maskverif](https://gitlab.com/benjgregoire/maskverif/tree/SPINI). Most
implementations have been manually verified to achieve threshold
(strong) non-interference at orders one or two. An optimized masked
implementation of the PRESENT sbox is provided at order one and
two. The implementations are provided in forms of gnu assembler code,
the higher-level intermediate language of scVerif and as dumps of
executable files.

## Setup ##
1. install scVerif using `make install`
2. link the models provided by scVerif in the `models` directory
   For example using the command `ln -s <PATH TO SCVERIF HOME>/models models`
